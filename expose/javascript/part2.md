## Part 2

1. It will print prices.length or 3
2. It will print 150, the last discounted price assigned in the for loop.
3. It will print 150, the last final price assigned in the for loop.
4. The function will return an array of discounted prices. Discount is an array that contains all the final prices of all price values passed in. 
5. The code will print an error because i is not a variable outside the loop.
6. DiscountedPrice is not a variable outside the loop, so there will be an error.
7. FinalPrice will return the final prices of all the prices after discount. 
8. The function will return an array of discounted prices. Using let variables the function works as designed.
9. The variable i is not accessible outside of the if block, so an error will be output. 
10. The console will print 3 since prices.length is 3. 
11. It will give an error because you cannot reassign a const inside a for loop.

12.  
     1. student.name
     2. student['Grad Year']
     3. student.greeting()
     4. student['Favorite Teacher'].name
     5. student.courseLoad[0]


13. 
    1.  '3'+2 = 32, 2 becomes a string
    2.  '3'-2 = 1, 3 becomes an int
    3.  3 + null = 3, null as an int is zero
    4.  '3' + null = 3null, null becomes string
    5.  true + 3 = 4, true = 1
    6.  false + null = 0, false and null both equal to 0
    7.  '3' + undefined = 3undefined, string concatenation
    8.  '3' - undefined = NaN, integer subtraction
14. 
    1.  ‘2’ > 1 = true, 2 > 1
    2.  ‘2’ < ‘12’ = false, 1 before 2 in strings
    3.  '2' == 2 = true, 2 is equal to 2
    4.  2 === ‘2’ = false, 2 is not the same type as '2'
    5.  true == 2 = false, true is equal to 1
    6.  true === Boolean(2) = true, Boolean(2) is true 
15. === checks for type as well as value, while == just checks for value
